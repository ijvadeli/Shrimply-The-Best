# Shrimply The Best THEME

## A custom theme based off of Cobalt2, Andromeda and shrimps.
Not alot to say, all colors were hand picked by me while looking at some beautiful shrimp pictures. I also took some inspiration from Cobalt2 and Andromeda since I really like both themes in their contrast and readability.
My favorite shrimp is the bluebolt shrimp, which is why it's heavily blue focused.
