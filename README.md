# Shrimply The Best THEME

## A custom theme based off of Cobalt2, Andromeda and shrimps.
All colors for this theme were hand picked by me. I also took some inspiration from Cobalt2 and Andromeda since I really like both themes in their contrast and readability.
My favorite shrimp is the bluebolt shrimp, which is why it's heavily blue focused.

## Install the theme
Since i'm not a big fan of giving microsoft my card info, you can install this theme yourself.
To start using this extension with Visual Studio Code, go to your extensions tab in vscode, click the 3 dots and select install from vsix. Now go to the folder of this theme and select the vsix file. Congrats, you have installed shrimply the best theme.

The other way to install it is by copying the vsix file into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
